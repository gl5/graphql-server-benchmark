= Backend

The backend is an HTTP server for author data.

== Running

For testing purposes, you may run it with Docker:

[source,bash]
----
docker build -t graphql-server-benchmark/backend .
docker run -it -p 8181:8181 graphql-server-benchmark/backend
----

Or, if you have a JDK8 (or JDK11) and Maven on your machine:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean vertx:run
----

== Testing

Author data can be retrieved with `HTTPie` or `curl`:

[source,bash]
----
http :8181/author/3
----

Which returns:

[source,bash]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 102
content-type: application/json

{
    "bio": "Small controls avoids most enlightenments.",
    "firstName": "William",
    "id": 3,
    "lastName": "Raymond"
}
